## ‚úîÔ∏è Android Compatibility and Ongoing Device Optimization
Our app is developed for Android devices and is optimized to be compatible with a wide range of screen sizes and resolutions. 
While our development primarily focused on devices similar to the Pixel 2, featuring a 5.0-inch screen with a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels and a density of 420dpi, we are aware of potential issues with aspect ratio on some devices. 
However, all features of the app function correctly, and we are committed to ongoing optimization to improve compatibility across different Android devices in future updates.
